# cs-565-HCI- Effect of design representation on generating feedback

With the increasing expansion of online communities, designers now are able to get feedback online. To obtain proper feedback from other
online community members, designers often use different design representations for their work. In this project, we have investigated the 
frequency of each design representation on Reddit. We have then summarized design representations into four categories, and have utilized Amazon Mechanical Turk to
analyze how people provide different feedback towards each design representation. We concluded that different design
representation will not affect the quality of the feedback, but will shift its focus. Therefore, designers need to choose
particular design representation to obtain the corresponding feedback.
